Let’s quickly **anchor the meaning**, then I’ll **adapt your website content around the ElimCrown brand**, clean and minimal.

---

## 1. What *ElimCrown* Communicates (this matters)

* **Elim** → growth, foundation, nurturing, elevation
* **Crown** → excellence, mastery, achievement, leadership

Together:

> **ElimCrown = nurturing learners towards mastery**

That aligns perfectly with CBC’s goal: **developing competence, not cramming content**.

---

## 2. Brand Positioning Statement (use this everywhere)

> **ElimCrown is a competency-based learning and assessment platform that helps schools teach coding, robotics, and digital skills through play — while capturing CBC evidence automatically.**

Short. Clear. Confident.
